# Full Stack MVP

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my new skills building an **Express server using RESTful API routes** and **PostgreSQL**, and then connect it to the front end user interface using the **jQuery library.** The following webpage application is a basic replica of what a local police department could utilize to get information for given license plates in a city and connect it to driver information. Utilizing **CRUD routes**, a **request** is made by the **client** and the **server** will **respond** with the given data from the vehicles database from a particular table.
